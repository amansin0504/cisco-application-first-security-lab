# Step 0: Getting Started and Setup of AWS and Sandbox

You're about to start on a doozy of lab that covers a lot of ground in a short time. Buckle in and get ready to secure a cloud-native application and public cloud infrastructure using Cisco Products: Tetration, Stealthwatch Cloud, and Duo. You'll stage the infrastructure, modify and deploy the application, instrument the security products into the environment. In the process, you'll get your hands dirty with products and technologies including git, Kubernetes, GitHub, Docker, AWS and others.

## Pre-requisites

1. [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) account with administrative privileges
2. [Cisco DevNet](https://developer.cisco.com/) account
3. A thirst for knowledge and willingness to get knee-deep in tech ðŸ¤“ðŸ’ª

## AWS Costs

_Approximately $1 USD per hour_

Wherever possible within the lab, efforts have been made to provision the minimal AWS resources necessary to minimize the financial burden on you, but this lab will not be zero cost exercise in AWS. The longer you leave the lab running, the higher the cost. If you complete the lab in one sitting it could take up to 4 hours depending on your familiarity with the technology used within the lab. We've seen roughly a cost of $1 USD per hour once the EKS Kubernetes Cluster comes online.

Make sure to review the [lab cleanup](#lab-cleanup) process once you're done with the lab.

## Getting Started

These quick steps will get you up and running. You'll need to reserve a DevNet sandbox, create AWS CloudFormation stack, and stage your Cloud9 IDE.

### Reserve DevNet Sandbox

1. Reserve a [Cisco Application-First Security Lab DevNet Sandbox](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/88e9fabf-abbf-4c0b-b1a1-c4999d794a10?diagramType=Topology). This step will get you access to Cisco Products for the duration of your sandbox reservation. You'll receive an email indicating that the reservation process has started. You'll receive two more emails.

3. You'll also receive an email from Stealhwatch Cloud to register your credentials. It's best to wait until you're instructed in the lab to setup that account to follow the instructions in that email.

4. Once your sandbox is ready, you'll receive another email that will contain essential information specific to your sandbox like your sandbox name and password. Keep that information handy when you create your AWS CloudFormation stack in upcoming steps.

### Create AWS CloudFormation Stack

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and select the region where you'd like to run this lab.

	> https://console.aws.amazon.com/

2. Navigate to EC2 AWS console and select _Network & Security > Key Pairs_ from the menu on the left pane. Provide a meaningful key pair name, leave all other details default and click on _Create key pair_. A _pem_ file with private key value will be downloaded, you can view the key in plain text in any of the text editors.

	> https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home
	
	> **NOTE**
	>
	> Rememeber the key pair name, you will need this in the next steps. 

3. Download the AWS CloudFormation template cf-template-setup.yaml within this repo. Take a minute to review the contents of the template to understand what resources you'll be creating.

	> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CiscoDevNet/cisco-application-first-security-lab/master/aws/cf-template-setup.yaml

3. Create an AWS CloudFormation stack by uploading the template you downloaded.

	> https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/create/template

	<p align="center"><img src="https://app-first-sec.s3.amazonaws.com/lab-guide.assets/image-20200818095442.png" alt="image-20200818095442" width="50%" /></p>

4. When prompted for a _Stack name_ use _cisco-app-first-sec_.

	<p align="center"><img src="https://app-first-sec.s3.amazonaws.com/lab-guide.assets/image-20200818091812.png" alt="image-20200818091812" width="50%" /></p>

5. Use the _PodName_, _PodPassword_, _SwcSecret_, _DuoSecret_, and _DevNetEmail_ values provided in the Sandbox reservation email for the _Parameters_ fields. For the _KeyPairName_, use the key pair name you provided in _step 1_

	> **NOTE**
	>
	> A strong password string is provided to you for the _PodPassword_ parameter. If you want to use your own, that's fine. You might need to use your own if the provided password doesn't meet your AWS Password Policy requirements like character length.
	>
	> We recommend that whatever value you set is used across all products when you're setting credentials as instructed in the lab guide to make things easier.

6. You don't need to adjust any other stack settings, so you can click _Next_ through the rest of the prompts. You will need to acknowledge that the template is creating an IAM User right before clicking _Create stack_. You'll use that IAM User in an upcoming step to run the lab in a AWS Cloud9 environment.

7. Now monitor the _Status_ for the stack you just created to be _CREATE\_COMPLETE_. If you're interested in watching each part of the stack progress, take a look at the stack _Events_.

	> **NOTE**
	>
	> The stack you created will automatically create another stack for the Cloud9 environment. While you can view the events from both stacks, you'll need to ensure that the stack you created (i.e., the non-Cloud9 stack) has completed before moving on.

8. Once the _cisco-app-first-sec_ stack is created, copy and paste the _Key_ and _Value_ content from the CloudFormation stack _Output_ for use in the next step.

	<p align="center"><img src="https://app-first-sec.s3.amazonaws.com/lab-guide.assets/image-20200818110152.png" alt="image-20200818110152" width="30%" /></p>

9. Sign out from your current AWS account and log in to the AWS Management Console again using the newly created IAM User.

	> https://console.aws.amazon.com

	This table maps the _Key_ name to the login input fields in the AWS Management Console.

	| AWS Account ID       | IAM user name       | Password            |
	| -------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
	| _AwsAccountId_ value | _IamUserName_ value | _PodPassword_ value |

10. Use the following link, click on _IamUserName_ and select the _Security credentials_ tab. Click on _Create access key_ button. Leave the _Success_ pop-up open so that you can return to copy the _Access key ID_ and _Secret access key_

    > https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/users/

    > **NOTE**
    >
    > This is the only time that the secret access keys can be viewed or downloaded. You cannot recover them later. However, you can create new access keys at any time.

### Stage Cloud9 IDE

1. In a new browser tab, as the newly created IAM User and within the same AWS region that you created the CloudFormation stack, navigate to [AWS Cloud9](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home) and click on _Open IDE_ for the _cisco-app-first-sec_ environment.

2. On Cloud9 IDE console, click on the _AWS Cloud9_ symbol and navigate to _Preferences_. In the _Preferences_ tab, in the navigation pane, choose _AWS Settings_, _Credentials_. Turn off _AWS managed temporary credentials_.

  <p align="center"><img src="https://app-first-sec.s3.amazonaws.com/lab-guide.assets/image-20191017202329590.png" alt="image-20191017202329590" width="50%" /></p>

> **NOTE**
>
> If you turn off AWS managed temporary credentials, by default the environment cannot access any AWS services, regardless of the AWS entity who makes the request. You will configure AWS profile in the next step to enable admin access.

3. Clone the lab repo into the Cloud9 environment.

	###### Command

	```
	git clone https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/cisco-application-first-security-lab.git lab
	```

	###### Output

	```
	Cloning into 'lab'...
	remote: Enumerating objects: 123, done.
	remote: Counting objects: 100% (123/123), done.
	remote: Total 123 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
	Unpacking objects: 100% (123/123), done.
	```

4. Run the provided _stagecloud9_ script to stage the Cloud9 environment and provide the name of your CloudFormation stack, which should be _cisco-app-first-sec_. This will install all the needed software packages and customize all templates including the lab guide with parameters you provided when creating the CloudFormation stack.

	###### Command

	```
	lab/bin/stagecloud9
	```

	###### Output

	```
	In order to access AWS resources from cloud9 terminal we need to set up the Access Keys.
	You will be prompted for the AWS Access key ID and AWS Secret Access Key now.
	Switch to the IAM console you left open in previous section (Create AWS CloudFormation Stack - Step 10).
	AWS Access Key ID: AKIA5FHL5UPMAKIA5F
	AWS Secret Access Key ID: e62cLfA6i6Sm+N3ycLfA6i6Sm+N3ycLfA6i6Sm+N3y
	
	In order to setup this lab environment, you need to
	provide the CloudFormation stack name used to setup
	the AWS infrastructure to support this lab.

	Here are the last few stacks that were created:

	aws-cloud9-appfirst-cloud9-ide-69e1341540f94694bac57255af470bfc [created at 2021-09-21T03:05:12.060Z]
	cisco-app-first-sec [created at 2021-09-21T03:04:21.106Z]

	What is the name of your CloudFormation stack for this lab? [Press enter for default: cisco-app-first-sec] 
	```


5. Set the necessary environment variables by sourcing your _.bashrc_. There won't be any output.

	###### Command

	```
	source ~/.bashrc
	```

> **WARNING**
>
> From now on all of the instructions  will be in the doc hosted in the Cloud9 environment. Do not continue to step 99 lab in this module until you have finished all of the steps there. Do **NOT** forget step 99 though, since there are costs associated with the running AWS instance.

**Nice job ðŸŽ‰ You're well on your way to becoming one with Cisco Application-First Security.**
