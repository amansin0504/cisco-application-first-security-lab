# Step 0: Getting Started and Setup of AWS and Sandbox

You're about to start on a doozy of lab that covers a lot of ground in a short time. Buckle in and get ready to secure a cloud-native application and public cloud infrastructure using Cisco Products: Tetration, Stealthwatch Cloud, and Duo. You'll stage the infrastructure, modify and deploy the application, instrument the security products into the environment. In the process, you'll get your hands dirty with products and technologies including git, Kubernetes, GitHub, Docker, AWS and others.

## Pre-requisites

1. [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) account with administrative privileges
2. [Cisco DevNet](https://developer.cisco.com/) account
3. A thirst for knowledge and willingness to get knee-deep in tech 🤓💪

## AWS Costs

_Approximately $1 USD per hour_

Wherever possible within the lab, efforts have been made to provision the minimal AWS resources necessary to minimize the financial burden on you, but this lab will not be zero cost exercise in AWS. The longer you leave the lab running, the higher the cost. If you complete the lab in one sitting it could take up to 4 hours depending on your familiarity with the technology used within the lab. We've seen roughly a cost of $1 USD per hour once the EKS Kubernetes Cluster comes online.

Make sure to review the [lab cleanup](#lab-cleanup) process once you're done with the lab.

> In general it's easy to have your AWS resources get costly, quick. It's highly recommended that you setup billing alerts so there aren't any surprises at the end of the month.

## Getting Started

These quick steps will get you up and running. You'll need to reserve a DevNet sandbox, create AWS CloudFormation stack, and stage your Cloud9 IDE.

### Reserve DevNet Sandbox

1. Reserve a [Cisco Application-First Security Lab DevNet Sandbox](TODO link to sandbox). This step will get you access to Cisco Products for the duration of your sandbox reservation. You'll receive an email indicating that the reservation process has started. You'll receive two more emails.

3. You'll also receive an email from Stealhwatch Cloud to register your credentials. It's best to wait until you're instructed in the lab to setup that account to follow the instructions in that email.

4. Once your sandbox is ready, you'll receive another email that will contain essential information specific to your sandbox like your sandbox name and password. Keep that information handy when you create your AWS CloudFormation stack in upcoming steps.

### Create AWS CloudFormation Stack

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and select the region where you'd like to run this lab.

	> https://console.aws.amazon.com/

2. Download the AWS CloudFormation template cf-template-setup.json within this repo. Take a minute to review the contents of the template to understand what resources you'll be creating.

	> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CiscoDevNet/cisco-application-first-security-lab/master/aws/cf-template-setup.json

3. Create an AWS CloudFormation stack by uploading the template you downloaded.

	> https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/create/template

	<p align="center"><img src="https://app-first-sec.s3.amazonaws.com/lab-guide.assets/image-20200818095442.png" alt="image-20200818095442" width="50%" /></p>

4. When prompted for a _Stack name_ use _cisco-app-first-sec_.

	<p align="center"><img src="https://app-first-sec.s3.amazonaws.com/lab-guide.assets/image-20200818091812.png" alt="image-20200818091812" width="50%" /></p>

5. Use the _PodName_, _PodPassword_, _SwcSecret_, _DuoSecret_, and _DevNetEmail_ values provided in the Sandbox reservation email for the _Parameters_ fields.

	> **NOTE**
	>
	> A strong password string is provided to you for the _PodPassword_ parameter. If you want to use your own, that's fine. You might need to use your own if the provided password doesn't meet your AWS Password Policy requirements like character length.
	>
	> We recommend that whatever value you set is used across all products when you're setting credentials as instructed in the lab guide to make things easier.

6. You don't need to adjust any other stack settings, so you can click _Next_ through the rest of the prompts. You will need to acknowledge that the template is creating an IAM User right before clicking _Create stack_. You'll use that IAM User in an upcoming step to run the lab in a AWS Cloud9 environment.

7. Now monitor the _Status_ for the stack you just created to be _CREATE\_COMPLETE_. If you're interested in watching each part of the stack progress, take a look at the stack _Events_.

	> **NOTE**
	>
	> The stack you created will automatically create another stack for the Cloud9 environment. While you can view the events from both stacks, you'll need to ensure that the stack you created (i.e., the non-Cloud9 stack) has completed before moving on.

8. Once the _cisco-app-first-sec_ stack is created, copy and paste the _Key_ and _Value_ content from the CloudFormation stack _Output_ for use in the next step.

	<p align="center"><img src="https://app-first-sec.s3.amazonaws.com/lab-guide.assets/image-20200818110152.png" alt="image-20200818110152" width="30%" /></p>

9. Sign out from your current AWS account and log in to the AWS Management Console again using the newly created IAM User.

	> https://console.aws.amazon.com

	This table maps the _Key_ name to the login input fields in the AWS Management Console.

	| AWS Account ID | IAM user name | Password |
	| -------------- | ------------- | -------- |
	| _AwsAccountId_ value | _IamUserName_ value | _PodPassword_ value |

### Stage Cloud9 IDE

1. As the newly created IAM User and within the same AWS region that you created the CloudFormation stack, navigate to [AWS Cloud9](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home) and open the _cisco-app-first-sec_ environment.

2. Open the Cloud9 IDE and access a terminal tab in the bottom right pane.

  <p align="center"><img src="https://app-first-sec.s3.amazonaws.com/lab-guide.assets/image-20191017202329590.png" alt="image-20191017202329590" width="50%" /></p>

3. Clone the lab repo into the Cloud9 environment.

	###### Command

	```
	git clone https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/cisco-application-first-security-lab.git lab
	```

	###### Output

	```
	Cloning into 'lab'...
	remote: Enumerating objects: 123, done.
	remote: Counting objects: 100% (123/123), done.
	remote: Total 123 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
	Unpacking objects: 100% (123/123), done.
	```

4. Run the provided _labsetup_ script to stage the Cloud9 environment and provide the name of your CloudFormation stack, which should be _cisco-app-first-sec_. This will install all the needed software packages and customize all templates including the lab guide with parameters you provided when creating the CloudFormation stack.

	###### Command

	```
	lab/bin/labsetup
	```

	###### Output

	```
	In order to setup this lab environment, you need to
	provide the CloudFormation stack name used to setup
	the AWS infrastructure to support this lab.
	...
	What is the name of your CloudFormation stack for this lab? [Press enter for default: cisco-app-first-sec]
	...
	```



5. Set the necessary environment variables by sourcing your _.bashrc_. There won't be any output.

	###### Command

	```
	source ~/.bashrc
	```

6. Use the file explorer in the Cloud9 environment to navigate to _lab/docs_. Right-click on _lab-guide.html_ and select _Preview_.

> **WARNING**
>
> From now on all of the instructions  will be in the doc hosted in the Cloud9 environment. Do not continue to step 99 lab in this module until you have finished all of the steps there. Do **NOT** forget step 99 though, since there are costs associated with the running AWS instance.

**Nice job 🎉 You're well on your way to becoming one with Cisco Application-First Security.**
